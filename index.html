	  		<p id="p1" class="paragraph">In the era of technology, there are a lot of devices for people to choose and try for the best experiences on all devices. But it’s important to keep updated with the most popular screen sizes and resolutions on mobile sites. Optimized and responsive site that is flow and ultimately can make the user be more enjoyable.
	  		<br>
	  		<br>
			Screen resolution refers to the clearly of the text and images displayed on your screen. The image of the computer screen is built up from millions of pixels. We can change the colours of the tiny square elements on the screen. Same screen size of devices does not mean that it has the same resolution. Therefore, developers can use the viewports on creating webpages. It will make the user has the enjoyable vision effect. Viewports are scaled down versions of resolutions that allows sites to be viewed more consistently across different devices. Viewports are often more standardized and smaller than resolution sizes. Because of some desktop and laptop displays in landscape orientation and some mobile devices can be rotated to show website in both and portrait orientation. Therefore, it means that designers and developers must design for these differences. Some common devices like smartphone, desktop or laptop all are usually using by users and normally all are related with screen resolution. The resolution you can use depends on the resolutions of your monitor supports. The larger the monitor, usually the higher the resolution it supports.</p>

			<li>Explain the significance of the speed of the internet connection between user’s devices and the internet. E.g : different file sizes and download times on the devices. </li>
				<p>The speed of internet connection has the relationship between different file size. For example, if the speed of internet connection is 1 Mbps, it is mean that we can download the file less than 1 minutes. So, this can show that the speed of the connection has the relationship between different file size. The bigger the file size, the time that needed to download the file is longer but the speed also can affect the time of the download time.</p>

			<br>
			<li>Describe the main features and capabilities found in modern web browsers. </li>
				<p>Nowadays, there are a lot of website are improving and competive in the market now. The excitement that comes with modern browsers is based on their capability to support CSS3 and HTML5. In addition, they have outstanding performance that supports intensive script processing and sophisticated graphic animation. The first capabilities are speed.  Modern browsers are made to work on the latest computers with the latest processors and graphic cards. Pages load and render faster and Java Scripts get executed faster. They also have better memory and storage management. Next, modern web browsers have good security features such as anti-phishing protection, malware detection and privacy or parental controls. Then, modern browsers support the latest web standards and technologies. For example, CSS3 properties such as rounded corners, drop shadows, text shadows, gradients, etc. are not support in IE8. IE9 has improved support for these properties but it still doesn’t support many standard properties. More CSS and less image files will significantly speed up the load time of a website. Last, all of the browsers are free to download and free to install and it only takes a few moments to download and install any of these browsers.</p>

			<li>State the different of HTML and HTML5 and identify its limitations. </li>
				<p>HTML was the first Internet language of the web. Anything displayed in a browser is organized via HTML and it’s central of the web development process and follow the era for progress. HTML works through “tags,” which tell a browser how to display specific pieces of text.
			<br>  
				<br>HTML’s latest evolution, HTML5 adds a ton of new features to the HTML and making it able to do so much more on its own. It’s a hybrid of three types of code which are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and by bundling these three components, HTML5 lets developers work faster and more efficiently. It makes the website be more flexible and compatible with more browsers.
			<br>
				<br>The limitation of HTML is the document that can be read by server but not the best fit to read by humans. The limitation of HTML5 are it isn't the solution for every problem. HTML5 can't move stored data to another machine, make copies, back it up, or open it with a different app.</p>

			<br>
			<li>Describe the importance of pixel. </li>
			<img src="img/img.02.jpg" width="600px" height="400px">
				<p><br>Pixel is the basic unit of programmable colour on a computer display or in a computer image. It is also the technological shorthand for picture element and basically a microscopic dot that forms a picture when combined with millions of other similar microscopic dots. Pixels is important in digital photography because they play a role in determining a photo's resolution and clarity. pixels can help to improve an image's quality and cropping a photo and producing a larger print.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>Explain the advantages and disadvantages between different graphics file formats suitable for use in a web page. </li>
				<p>
					The advantages of JPEG are almost every digital camera can use in the JPEG format. The file of the JPEG is smaller, which means that it takes up less memory. Therefore JPEG has been considered as standard. GIF is most suitable for graphics, images or diagrams with few colours. GIF is still the chosen format for animation effects. GIF compared with JPEG, it is lossless and thus more effective with compressing images with a single colour. It can support transparency for image with limited colour. BMP files are image files in the Microsoft Windows operating system. These files are large and uncompressed, but the images are rich in colour and all in high quality. It is also simple and compatible in all Windows OS and programs.
				<br>
  				<br>The disadvantages of JPEG are they tend to discard a lot of data and after
					compression, JPEG tends to create artifacts. It also cannot be animated and it does notsupport transparency. Therefore, JPEG is less suitable for working with text. Then, iflarge numbers of them are used on a webpage, GIF can take a very long time for them all to load. Besides that, GIF is the oldest format in the web and hasn’t been updated.disadvantages of BMP are it does not scale or compress well. Moreover, huge image filesmake the web become not friendly and it is not real advantage than other image format.

			<li>Explain the issues involving copyright relevant to internet websites.</li>
				<img src="img/img.03.jpg" width="600px" height="400px">
				<p>Copyright is a form that protect to “original works of authorship,” of the authors which including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works. This protection is available to both published and unpublished works for avoid the guilty of copyright infringement. Therefore, web page author should take care on not to copy the work of others. An Internet service provider can also be found liable for copyright infringement even when they are not directly engaged in the copying of protected materials. So, the web page author must be careful and do not violated it. Web page author cannot copy the image of others but they can try to crate original images from drawing and painting programs and it is better to start from scratch rather than from someone else's creation. If they copy the image of others web page author, even the showing of the image changed, but it is also violated their image.</p>

			<br>
			<li>Explain the term ‘viewport’.</li>
			<img src="img/img.04.jpg" width="600px" height="400px">
				<p>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport different with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.  web pages were designed only for computer screens and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size. Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. For example, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.  </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<li>Identify the function of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
				<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of markup codes that can inserted in a file and display on a World Wide Web browser page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images for the user. Each markup code is referred as an element or tag. 
					<br>
				CSS is functional to designed the layout, colors, and fonts of a webpage. This can improve content accessibility and make the layout be more flexibility. CSS can cooperate with HTML for created a better website because some function can be added by using CSS. Therefore, the website can be more compatible than the website that without CSS.
					<br>
				JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that helps HTML designers to effectively and interactively design websites and web pages in a very simple and efficient way. It also can handle dynamic effects on scripting language which has features to achieve dynamic effects in web pages. Besides that, JavaScript also has the feature of validating data submitted at the client level. This helps in saving the processing time of the server.</p>

			<li>Explain How CSS Colours representation in Hexadecimal.</li>
				<p>Hexadecimal color is a mixing of RGB and the values can support in all the browsers. RGB is standing for RRGGBB which is RR(red), GG (green) and BB (blue). The calculation of RGB to Hexadecimal color is by using base 16 because RGB is 256x256x256. It is a hexadecimal integer between 00 and FF and specifying the intensity of the color by follow the RGB. A hexadecimal color is a value that range from 0 to 255 in decimal number but it is more easy to read in 2 Hexadecimal digit from 00 to FF. For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 00.</p>
